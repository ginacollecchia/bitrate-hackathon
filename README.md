SCROLLHOLE is a scrolling interface for making sound, designed by [Gina Collecchia](http://ginacollecchia.com) and [Eric Heep](http://ericheep.com). Scroll up and down to travel through the hole. Scroll long enough, fast enough, and you WILL be rewarded.

Submitted for the [2020 BitRate Hackathon](https://bitrate.devpost.com/), sponsored by Gray Area and Google. Made with Tone.js, P5.js, and Magenta.js.

Special thanks to [Myles Borins](https://mylesborins.com) for help with Node shtuff! Check out his [Oscilot](https://github.com/MylesBorins/oscilot) repo to make your own Node-powered site.
